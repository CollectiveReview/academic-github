# Platform for Open Science
[Project Development Overview](https://www.notion.so/code4japan-community/16c5dee106f847d996324e40464325ff?pvs=4)

We are building a OSS software for researchers to collaborate for their reseach projects like programmers do on github for their software developments.
Our goal is to establish a platform such that:
- **Contribution Driven** - evyeryone can edit article, add data or reference. Each modification undergo review, and when accepted it is hornored under your name.
- **Universal citation** - repository can accept any format of data, and every citation is expressed via doi. Citaions are the dependency of the projects. Each citation is a link and points the single source of truth.
- **Collective review** - the validity and impact of a project is measured by how many other projects accept it. We don't need to rely on busy peers, which may biased and taking much time.

## Specification
We are using:

- Frontend: Next, Material UI, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), firebase Hosting
- Backend: Firebase Authentication(Sign in with Google), Realtime database (Save Metadata)
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Visit: 

When you try this locally,

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
in top directory `npm install`
=======
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
then

`next dev`

make sure you have installed next in your global environment.

### Deploy
bash
`npm run build`

`firebase deploy --only hosting`



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
=======
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
