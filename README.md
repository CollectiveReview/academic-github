# Platform for Open Science
[Project Development Overview](https://www.notion.so/code4japan-community/16c5dee106f847d996324e40464325ff?pvs=4)

We are building a OSS software for researchers to collaborate for their reseach projects like programmers do on github for their software developments.
Our goal is to establish a platform such that:
- **Contribution Driven** - evyeryone can edit article, add data or reference, undergo reviewing. 
- **Continuously developing** - 

## Specification
We are using:

- Frontend: Next, Material UI, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), firebase Hosting
- Backend: Firebase Authentication(Sign in with Google), Realtime database (Save Metadata)

## Getting Started

clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/CollectiveReview/react-yjs.git`

in top directory `yarn install`

`cd functions` `npm install`

then

`npm start`

### Deploy
bash
`npm run build`

`firebase deploy --only hosting`



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
